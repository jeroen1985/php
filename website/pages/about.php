	<p>A bit more about the founder. Born and raised in the Netherlands, definitely proud to be Dutch and more than happily living in Vancouver. Who's Jeroen? My parents would probably say: "always working on those computers". As of a very young age I was playing around with dos, win 3.1 and the first linux distributions. Technology grabbed my attention, but my interests are so much broader. I am interested in programming, technology, politics, economics, philosophy, basketball, the outdoors, Canadian mountains and always open to have a casual drink. I followed several studies related to business and IT. Next to my studies I was always working on websites using different technologies, i.e. Php, Python, JavaScript, jQuery. After finishing my Master's degree in business and information management; I rapidly gained tons of experience within Global IT consultancy firms located in the Netherlands (Amsterdam). I landed a job as a programmer after my relocation to Vancouver, this allowed me to gain more in depth web programming experience. I am currently employed for the primary liquidity manager in BC as a software specialist.</p>
